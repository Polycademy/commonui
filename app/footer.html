						<span><strong>Note!</strong> This page demonstrates a sticky footer, which means that the generic skeleton has been modified to suit. The sticky footer is where the footer stays on the bottom of the browser's window even when there is not enough content to push it down. This is not the same as the fixed footer, if there is enough content, then the footer will be pushed down as normal. This isn't usually required because there is usually enough content, but it may be useful for web applications that fit within a single window! However you have to decide whether to use a fixed footer or sticky footer in that case. The disadvantage with using a sticky footer, is that you need to know what your footer's height is at all times, and you need to manually input it. This is alright because footers hardly change after being made!</span>

			<!-- This footer transition is so we can apply a top border transition colour to help the footer blend in with the top. There are other ways to do this, the only reason we're doing it this way, is because this works with the sticky footer. If we applied a border or padding onto the footer itself, it would stuff up the stickiness. If we didn't need to worry about the sticky footer, we could simply apply the border onto the footer itself, or to the main content's bottom when it pushes down the footer. -->
